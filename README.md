# 2.4 GHz LNA using Keysight ADS

This repository contains a project for designing a Low Noise Amplifier (LNA) operating at 2.4 GHz frequency. The purpose of this project is to gain practical experience in RF circuit design and to understand the fundamentals of LNA design for future C band LNA design.

## Project Overview

The project involves the following key steps:
1. **Requirements Analysis**: Define the specifications and requirements of the LNA, including gain, noise figure, bandwidth, and input/output impedance.
2. **Circuit Design**: Design the LNA circuit using RF design techniques and tools like Keysight ADS.
3. **Simulation**: Simulate the LNA circuit using simulation software Keysight ADS to verify its performance and optimize its parameters.
4. **Layout Design**: Create the layout of the LNA circuit, considering factors such as component placement, routing, and impedance matching.

## Specification

- **Frequency**: 2.4GHz
- **Gain**: >30dB
- **Noise Figure**: <2dB
- **Temperature Range**: 0 to +60 °C
- **Output Third Order Intercept (OIP3)**: +20 dBm (minimum)
- **Input VSWR**: 1.30 : 1
- **Output VSWR**: 1.30 : 1
- **Power Output (@ 1-dB Gain Compression)**: +10 dBm (minimum)

## Goals

- Unconditional stability over wide bandwidth (atleast 1 GHz).
- Harmonious Gain (>30dB) and minimum Noise figure (<2dB).
- Ensure best input and output matching circuit.
- Wide Band Operatability of the LNA.
- Minimize the NFmin.
